# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This interactive web application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Gain insights into how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort operate by watching them sort a visual representation of data.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.

- **Customize Input Data**: Adjust the size and range of the input data to see how different algorithms perform under various conditions.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Follow the sorting process step by step to understand the inner workings of each algorithm.

- **Real-time Updates**: Watch as the visual representation of the data updates in real-time, providing a dynamic and engaging learning experience.
